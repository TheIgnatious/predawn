# Mailspring Predawn UI theme

A dark UI theme for the [Mailspring](https://getmailspring.com/) email client. This theme is a fork of the [Nylas N1 Predawn UI theme](https://github.com/adambmedia/N1-Predawn) by [Adam Boulanger](https://github.com/adambmedia) and is extensively based on the [Sublime/Atom Predawn UI theme](https://github.com/jamiewilson/predawn) by [Jamie Wilson](https://github.com/jamiewilson).
